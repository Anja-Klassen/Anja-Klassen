Welcome to my profil!

I am Anja and just startet the Web Development bootcamp with neue fische.
I studied social work and psychology with a focus on social psychology. 
I like to reorient myself towards web development and UX/UI and would love to connect my experience as a social worker and psychologist in this new field.
I really like to work in non-profit-projects and for the social good.
